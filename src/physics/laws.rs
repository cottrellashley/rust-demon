/// A trait representing a pairwise interaction between two particles.
///
/// This trait defines a method to compute the effect of an interaction between two particles.
/// The interaction is applied only to the first particle (`obj1`), which is passed as a mutable reference,
/// while the second particle (`obj2`) is passed as an immutable reference.
///
/// # Details
///
/// - **Mutable vs. Immutable:**
///   `obj1` is mutable and its state will be updated as a result of the interaction.
///   `obj2` is immutable (read-only). In a simulation that iterates over all pairs,
///   you would eventually call the method with the roles reversed so that every particle is updated.
///
/// - **Return Value:**
///   The method returns a `Particle` representing the updated state of `obj1` after applying the interaction.
///   (This return value could be used to update the simulation state.)
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// // Assuming that CoulombLaw implements PairwiseInteraction:
/// let mut p1 = Particle::new(/* parameters here */);
/// let p2 = Particle::new(/* parameters here */);
/// let law = CoulombLaw::new(/* parameters here */);
/// p1 = law.resolve(&mut p1, &p2);
/// ```
///
pub trait InteractionLaw {

    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `obj1`: A mutable reference to the first particle. Its state will be updated based on the interaction.
    /// - `obj2`: An immutable reference to the second particle. Its state remains unchanged.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// Returns a `Particle` reflecting the updated state of `obj1` after the interaction.

/// A structure representing the Coulomb force interaction between charged particles.
///
/// Coulomb's law states that the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges
/// is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
/// This struct encapsulates the constant and parameters needed to compute that force.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// * `k` - The Coulomb constant. Typically, this is \(8.9875517923 \times 10^9 \, \text{NÂ·m}^2/\text{C}^2\).
/// * `softening` - A small value added (squared) to the denominator to avoid singularities when particles are extremely close.
/// * `cutoff` - A distance threshold beyond which the force is not applied.
///             (Particles farther apart than this value will not interact.)
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use crate::physics::coulomb_law::CoulombLaw;
/// use crate::physics::particles::Particle;
///
/// // Create a new CoulombLaw instance with a given constant, softening parameter, and cutoff.
/// let coulomb = CoulombLaw::new(8.9875517923e9, 0.001, 100.0);
///
/// // Later, you might use this instance to compute the interaction between two particles:
/// // coulomb.resolve(&mut particle1, &mut particle2);
/// ```
